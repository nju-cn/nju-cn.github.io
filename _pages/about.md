I am now a Lecturer in Department of Computer Science and Technology in **SooChow University**. My research interests are broadly in edge intelligence. More specifically, I focus on two different directions:

 **AI for Edge** : Using ML algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) to solve the potential edge‑oriented problems, e.g., resource allocation and request scheduling (TPDS 2020, CN 2021, ICPADS 2019);

 **Edge for AI**: Applying edge computing paradigm to advance the AI applications (e.g., video analytics, video streaming enhancement and federal learning) (INFOCOM 23, CN 21).

In recent two years, I’ve worked on AI/ML‑oriented video system optimization.
